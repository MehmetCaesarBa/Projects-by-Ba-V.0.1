    """
    FastAPI lifespan context manager — runs startup logic before the server
    begins accepting requests, and teardown logic on shutdown.

    Startup checks (fail-fast philosophy):
    Both checks are informational rather than blocking — the server starts
    regardless of their outcome so that a developer can still hit /check
    and see a clear error message rather than a refused connection.
    Blocking startup on model availability would prevent the server from
    running even when Ollama is temporarily restarting mid-development.

    1. ollama_client.health_check()
       Pings localhost:11434 to confirm Ollama is running. Prints a
       "run: ollama serve" hint if unreachable.

    2. ollama_client.ensure_models_available()
       Queries /api/tags and PULLS anything missing rather than only
       reporting it. This replaced a check-and-warn call so that a fresh
       clone works without the reader downloading a 2 GB GGUF by hand or
       following the Colab notebook first — the first run fetches what is
       absent, later runs find it cached.

       Set AUTOCITATION_NO_AUTOPULL=1 to fall back to reporting only. CI
       wants that: a test run should fail loudly on a missing model, not
       quietly download several gigabytes.

    These checks surface the two most common local setup mistakes (Ollama
    not started, models not pulled) in the server log at startup rather
    than as cryptic ConnectionRefused errors during the first request.
