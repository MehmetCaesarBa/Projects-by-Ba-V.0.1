"""
Single-call verifier probe.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Prompt edits to verifier.py have now produced three different
verdicts on one unchanged case, and each attempt cost a full pipeline run — 400
to 900 seconds of extraction, Wikipedia retrieval and clause handling — to test
a change that affects exactly one inference call. One experiment per sitting is
how guesses replace measurements.

This runs that one call. Claim in, evidence in, verdict out, in the time qwen3
takes to think. No spaCy, no network, no extraction. Decoding is greedy with a
fixed seed, so a repeat run on an unchanged prompt is bit-identical: any
difference you see was caused by the thing you changed.

    python verifier_probe.py --list
    python verifier_probe.py --all
    python verifier_probe.py --case python_gc --show-think
    python verifier_probe.py --all --no-supports-clause
    python verifier_probe.py --all --sweep-thinking

WHAT IT DOES NOT TEST. Retrieval. Every case hands the verifier a chunk chosen
by hand, which is the point: it separates "the verifier misread good evidence"
from "retrieval never delivered the evidence". Those look identical in a
pipeline log and need opposite fixes. A passing probe is not a passing pipeline.
