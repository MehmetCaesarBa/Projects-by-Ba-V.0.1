    WHY PART OF SPEECH IS THE MISSING INFORMATION. A stemmer is string rewriting
    with no concept of a name, so any rule that strips a terminal 's' turns
    every place name ending in -s into a plural: Paris->pari, Athens->athen,
    Wales->wale. Fact-checking prose is dense with such names, and a mangled
    name silently stops matching its own mention elsewhere.

    No pure stemmer can do better — once the string is lowercased, 'Paris' and
    'parries' are indistinguishable. The POS tag is what separates them, and
    spaCy already computes it for this text.

    The second gain is the opposite direction: lemmatisation collapses
    inflectional variants a suffix stripper misses entirely, including
    irregulars ('held'->'hold', 'built'->'build', 'went'->'go'), which is what
    the faithfulness gate needs when the extractor rewrites a clause. Fewer

    `rejected_attempts` carries (attempt_text, foreign_words) pairs for outputs
    the faithfulness gate refused this round. It exists because the extractor
    now runs at temperature 0: greedy decoding is a deterministic function of
    the prompt, so re-sending an unchanged prompt after a rejection reproduces
    the rejected output *exactly*, forever. One observed run burned iterations
    2 through 10 re-emitting the same sentence verbatim. Feeding the rejection
    back is what makes the retry a different question rather than a replay —
    and it turns the gate from a silent filter into a correction signal.

    `target_sentence` narrows what may be extracted while leaving the full
    document visible. The two roles are deliberately distinct:

        original_text   — CONTEXT. Read-only. Exists so pronouns resolve.
        target_sentence — TARGET.  The only source of new facts this round.

    Both are needed. Scoping to a sentence bounds the decomposition problem and
    stops one uncooperative sentence from consuming the whole budget, but a
    sentence read in isolation is often unverifiable: "You can walk between
    them with Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge" has no recoverable meaning without the
    sentence before it. Keeping the document in view is what lets "them"
    resolve while the extraction stays scoped.

    Distinguish the two very different situations that both surface as NEI.

    'NOT ENOUGH INFO' currently collapses two states that call for opposite
    responses:

      RETRIEVAL_FAILURE — the evidence never mentions what the claim is about,
        so no verdict was ever possible. Recoverable: re-query and try again.
        This is what happened to "Bosporus is located between Africa and
        Europe": the query was built from Africa and Europe alone, the
        Bosporus article was never fetched, and the verifier was asked to
        adjudicate a strait using chunks about African rainfall. Its NEI was
        the correct response to bad evidence, not a statement about the claim.

      GENUINE — the right articles were retrieved and are authentically
        silent or ambiguous on this particular point. Terminal: no better
        query will help.

    The test is deliberately mechanical rather than another LLM call: does the
    claim's subject appear anywhere in the retrieved text? Zero mentions
    across every chunk means the evidence is not about the claim at all.

    Returns "RETRIEVAL_FAILURE", "GENUINE", or "UNKNOWN" when the subject
    could not be recovered (pronoun subject, parse failure) and the question
    cannot be decided this way.

    # Match on the subject's PROPER NOUN, falling back to its longest token.
    #
    # Requiring the whole phrase would produce false negatives that look like
    # retrieval failures — retrieved prose says "the Bosporus", "Bosporus
    # Strait", "Bosphorus" — so some single token has to stand in for the
    # subject. Choosing WHICH token is the entire difficulty, and two previous
    # answers were wrong:
    #
    #   split()[-1]            The head word. Too permissive when that head is a
    #                          common noun: "Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge" matched
    #                          on 'bridge' against a passage comparing tower
    #                          heights, and "water molecules" matched on
    #                          'molecules' in an article about the properties of
    #                          water. Both reported GENUINE; both were retrieval
    #                          failures.
    #
    #   max(split(), key=len)  The longest token, as a proxy for the rarest. It
    #                          fixes those two and then reproduces the same bug
    #                          whenever a common noun is simply longer:
    #
    #                            'English settlement of Jamestown'
    #                             English=7  settlement=10  Jamestown=9
    #                             -> picks 'settlement'
    #
    #                          which matches almost any colonial-era passage, so
    #                          the diagnosis is GENUINE by construction. Observed
    #                          on a real run, where it happened to agree with the
    #                          truth and therefore told the reader nothing.
    #
    # Length was never the property being reached for. The property is "does
    # this string name ONE thing?", and part of speech answers it directly: a
    # proper noun is a name, a common noun is a category. spaCy has already
    # tagged this text, so the answer costs nothing. Length survives only as the
    # fallback for subjects with no proper noun at all ("water molecules"),
    # where the old proxy remains the best available.
    #
    # WHY THIS MATTERS BEYOND TIDINESS: GENUINE means "the right evidence was
    # retrieved and is authentically silent", which is terminal — no better
    # query will help. RETRIEVAL_FAILURE means "try again". Getting them the
    # wrong way round tells the operator to stop looking at exactly the moment
