WIKIPEDIA_SEARCH_LIMIT = 3

# LABEL_COLORS: CSS class tokens used by the frontend to color-code each

# STEP 1 — Wikipedia URL Resolution
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
def resolve_wikipedia_url(query: str) -> str:
    """
    Resolves a free-text NER search query to a canonical Wikipedia article URL.

    Why not construct the URL directly from the NER query?
    The NER query produced by ner.extract_query() is a multi-entity phrase
    (e.g., "Mehmed II Constantinople") optimized for Wikipedia's search
    engine, not for direct URL construction. Directly URL-encoding that
    phrase would produce a Special:Search URL rather than a real article
    page, which renders as a search results page in the browser — a poor
    citation experience.

    Instead, we hit the Wikipedia opensearch API (the same endpoint that
    powers the Wikipedia search bar) to resolve the query to its canonical
    page title, then construct a /wiki/<Title> URL from that title.

    Disambiguation handling:
    Wikipedia's opensearch can return disambiguation pages (e.g.,
    "Mehmed II (disambiguation)") as the top result when multiple articles
    share a name. We detect this by checking for "(disambiguation)" in the
    title and fall through to the next candidate if found. If all candidates
    are disambiguation pages or the list is exhausted, FALLBACK_URL is
    returned.

    Network resilience:
    Any requests exception (timeout, DNS failure, Wikipedia API outage)
    is caught and logged without crashing the pipeline. The verifier has
    already completed by the time this function is called, so a URL
    resolution failure should never block the main result from reaching
    the frontend.

    Args:
        query : free-text search string from ner.extract_query()
                (e.g., "Mehmed II Constantinople", "Python Guido van Rossum")

    Returns:
        Canonical Wikipedia article URL string (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...)

# STEP 2 — Label Normalization
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
def normalize_label(raw_label: str) -> str:
    """
    Normalizes a raw verifier label string to one of the three canonical values.

    verifier.py's parse_verification_response() already enforces the label
    set {SUPPORTS, REFUTES, NOT ENOUGH INFO}. However, main.py may call
    postprocessor with results assembled from multiple stages, and edge cases
    exist where a label could arrive with inconsistent casing, extra
    whitespace, or a truncated value (e.g., "NOT ENOUGH" if the model cut
    its output mid-token).

    This function acts as a defensive normalization gate so that the final
    API response always contains a valid, frontend-renderable label string.

    Normalization rules (applied in order):
    1. Strip leading/trailing whitespace.
    2. Uppercase the entire string.
    3. Partial match: if the string starts with "NOT" → "NOT ENOUGH INFO"
       (handles "NOT ENOUGH", "NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION", etc.)
    4. Exact match against the canonical set.
    5. Default to "NOT ENOUGH INFO" for anything unrecognized.

    Args:
        raw_label : label string returned by verifier.verify()

    """
    Assembles one complete verification result dict for a single atomic fact.

    This is the function that transforms the raw pipeline outputs (strings
    from verifier.py) into the structured response object defined in the
    API contract. It is the only place where source_url is attached,
    label_color is derived, and evidence truncation is applied.

    Evidence truncation:
    verifier.py instructs the reasoning model to "copy the single most
    relevant evidence chunk exactly." In practice, qwen3:8b sometimes echoes
    the full chunk (up to 500 characters). The frontend results table renders
    this inline, so we truncate to 300 characters with an ellipsis to keep
    the table scannable without hiding the key evidence sentence.

    Label color:
    The color field maps the label to a CSS class token consumed by the
    frontend. Deriving it here (rather than in the frontend JS) keeps all
    label-to-presentation logic in one place and avoids duplicating the
    mapping in the HTML file.

    Args:
        claim     : original atomic claim string from claim_extractor
        label     : raw label string from verifier.verify() [pre-normalization]
        rationale : one-sentence explanation from verifier.verify()

                    this claim — used to resolve the Wikipedia source URL

def aggregate(raw_results: list[dict]) -> dict:
    """
    Aggregates a list of per-fact result dicts into the final API response body.

    Called by main.py after all atomic facts have been extracted, retrieved,
    and verified. Takes the flat list of assembled result dicts and wraps
    them in a top-level response envelope that includes:

    1. results      : the ordered list of per-fact dicts
    2. summary      : label frequency counts (how many SUPPORTS / REFUTES /
                      NOT ENOUGH INFO across all facts in the input)
    3. overall_label: a single top-level verdict for the entire input text,
                      derived from the majority label across all facts.
                      Tie-breaking order: REFUTES > NOT ENOUGH INFO > SUPPORTS,
                      because a single refuted claim is more significant than
                      uncertain or supported claims when assessing credibility.
    4. total_claims : total number of atomic facts that were processed

    Why include summary and overall_label?
    The frontend results table shows per-fact detail, but the user's primary
    question is "is my text well-supported?" A single top-level verdict
    answers that immediately without requiring the user to scan all rows.
    The summary counts provide the evidence behind that verdict.

    Tie-breaking rationale (REFUTES > NOT ENOUGH INFO > SUPPORTS):
    In a fact-checking context, a single refuted claim in an otherwise
    supported text signals a meaningful factual error. An "all supported"
    verdict despite one refuted claim would be actively misleading.
    The conservative ordering ensures the overall verdict never overstates
    confidence in the input text.

    Args:
        raw_results : list of dicts, each from assemble_result().
                      Expected keys per dict: claim, label, label_color,
