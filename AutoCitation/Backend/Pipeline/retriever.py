# STEP 3 — Lexical Chunk Scoring
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Named "Semantic" until it was noticed that nothing here computes meaning.
# This is term matching weighted by rarity — a chunk saying "particle
# accelerator" scores zero against a claim saying "particle collider", because
# the strings differ. Calling it semantic invites a reader to assume embedding
# machinery exists somewhere in the project. It does not.

# ── Ranking parameters ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# add noise without meaning. Previously the inline `len(t) > 2`.
MIN_SCORE_TOKEN_LENGTH = 3

# USE_IDF_WEIGHTING: weight each matched token by how RARE it is across the
# chunks retrieved for this claim, instead of counting every token equally.
#
# The unweighted version treated 'bosporus' and 'europe' as worth the same,
# which is how a passage about African rainfall scored 0.42 against a claim
# about a strait — it matched 'africa', 'europe' and 'between' while missing the
# only word that identified the subject. Rare terms are what distinguish a
# relevant passage; common ones are satisfied by almost anything.
#
# The document frequencies come from the ~30-90 chunks just retrieved, not a
# global corpus. That is deliberate: it needs no index, no download and no
# dependency, and it is arguably better suited to the task — a term appearing in
# every chunk fetched for THIS claim is uninformative for choosing between them,
# whatever its frequency in English at large.
#
# KNOWN BIAS, worth stating plainly because it shapes what this can and cannot
# do: the rarest token in a claim is almost always its SUBJECT NAME, so chunks
# mentioning the subject dominate. Evidence that would REFUTE "X was first" is
# typically a passage about someone ELSE, which by construction does not contain
# X. Rarity weighting therefore sharpens relevance and does nothing for
# counter-evidence — arguably it makes that harder. Fixing it needs diversity in
# selection or a differently-built query, not a different weighting.

# when measuring whether this helped.

    this claim and df(t) = how many of them contain t.

    The +1 inside the log keeps the weight strictly positive: a term present in
